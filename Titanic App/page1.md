# Titanic: Tragedy in the Atlantic ðŸš¢
Over a century ago, on the night of April 15, 1912, the Titanic, a symbol of human ingenuity and luxury, met an untimely end. The tragic event unfolded in the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, where the ship struck an iceberg and sank to the depths below.

> The ship took about two and a half hours to sink, and it was fully submerged by approximately 2:20 AM on April 15, 1912.

# Passengers and Crew
On board the Titanic, there were a total of 2,240 people, including both passengers and crew. Tragically, approximately 1,500 of these individuals lost their lives in the disaster.

The Titanic offered three different types of tickets

The Titanic had three distinct classes, each with a different ticket price range:

1. **First Class**: The most expensive class on the Titanic. There were two different options in the First Class â€“ Suite and Berth. The suite was significantly more costly than the Berth option. The First Class was mainly taken by millionaires, actors, and other rich people for leisure or vacation. The ticket prices in 1912 ranged from $150 for a Berth to $4,350 for a Suite. In todayâ€™s money, this would be approximately $4,591 for a Berth and $133,132 for a Suite.

2. **Second Class**: This was the second most expensive class on the RMS Titanic. Tourists from around the globe mainly occupied the second class. A second-class ticket on the Titanic cost $60 in 1912, which would be about $1,834 in todayâ€™s money.

3. **Third Class**: This was the least expensive class on the Titanic, also known as â€˜Steerageâ€™. It was occupied by immigrants leaving Europe for America. A third-class ticket on the Titanic cost $35 in 1912, which would be around $1,071 in todayâ€™s money.

Itâ€™s also worth noting that even though the most expensive First Class Suite ticket was priced at $4,350, it was reportedly not occupied during the Titanicâ€™s maiden voyage. The most expensive ticket sold for that voyage cost $2,560, equivalent to about $75,000 in todayâ€™s money.

# Dataset
As part of our exploration, weâ€™ll be utilizing the `Titanic` data set, made available through the `datasets` package.

The dataset provides detailed information about:

- ***Class***: The level of service each passenger was entitled to - First, Second, or Third class.
- ***Sex***: Gender of the passengers - male or female.
- ***Age***: The ages of the passengers.
- ***Survival***: Reveals whether the passenger survived the disaster or not.
We aim to uncover patterns and narratives that help us better understand the fateful journey of the Titanic and the lives intertwined with it.
